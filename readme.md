# feedback platform

this should be the fastest and easiest way to get feedback on your projects as a developer.

i think i need to sleep fuckk! just lost $62k trading


## WHAT I WANT TO IMPLEMENT

1. User Authentication: to allow users to create accounts and log in to submit feedback.
2. Feedback Submission Forms: creating customizable forms for collecting feedback, including rating systems and open-ended questions.
3. Dashboard for Users: making a ui where feedback providers can view their submitted feedback and any responses.
4. Admin Dashboard: a small backend interface for admins (esp myself) to manage feedback, analyze trends, and generate reports.
5. Notifications: an email and also in-app notifications for feedback responses or important updates.
5. Data Export: well, considering options to download feedback data in formats like CSV or Excel.

## TECH STACK

1. Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript/Typescript (considering using the opportunity to master reactjs)
2. Back-End: considering using Python (Flask), i am not using PHP because i intentionally didn't setup PHP
3. Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB for storing feedback and user information
4. Deployment: Platforms like Heroku, Railway, or AWS for hosting your application
